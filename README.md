### No need to insert coin!
Pac-Bar is the game you never knew you needed. Perfect for when you're bored at work or just want to relax a little, it puts the classic arcade experience right at your fingertips by trapping the beloved dot-munching hero in a Touch Bar-sized maze. To even the odds, he's only being chased by a single ghost this time, but don't let this fool you: avoiding Binky is just as tricky as it was in the arcade classic. Use the warp tunnels at the edge of the maze to put some distance between you and your red foe, and maybe even escape certain death!

## Gameplay
`⚠️ Note: A Touch Bar is required to play`

The aim of the game is to eat all the dots scattered throughout the maze, but beware: if Blinky touches you, it's game over! If you succeed in clearing the maze, you'll proceed to the next level... which is the same as the last. The maze can reset an infinite number of times, so keep eating those dots until you get caught. You can move Pac-Man using the arrow keys on your keyboard, so use them wisely to keep Pac-Man out of danger. The maze has warp tunnels around the edges that work in mysterious ways... if you try to run out the side of the maze you'll find yourself at the other end. The tunnels at the top and bottom transport you not only vertically but also horizontally: if you go up the left tunnel you'll find yourself at the bottom right of the maze, and vice-versa. Use this to your advantage if you're in a sticky situation!
